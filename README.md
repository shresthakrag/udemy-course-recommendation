# Udemy Course Recommendation System

## Project Description and Objectives
This project aims to develop a recommendation system for online courses based on user preferences and course characteristics. The primary objective is to provide personalized course recommendations to users, helping them discover relevant courses efficiently.

## Instructions for Setting Up and Running the Project
To set up and run the project, follow these steps:
* Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
* Install the required libraries.
* Run the Jupyter Notebook "Course Recommendation system.ipynb".

## Recommendation Model
We have chosen a content-based filtering approach for our recommendation model. This method recommends items based on the features of the items and a profile of the user's preferences. The rationale behind this choice is that content-based filtering can capture the unique characteristics of courses and users' preferences, providing more accurate recommendations. It also handles the cold start problem better than collaborative filters, as it does not require user-item interaction data for new items or users.

## Results and Model Evaluation Metrics
We have evaluated the performance of our recommendation model using the following metrics:
* Precision: The proportion of recommended courses that are relevant to the user.
* Recall: The proportion of relevant courses that are successfully recommended to the user.
* F1-score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced assessment of the model's performance.

To assess the effectiveness of the recommendation system, we consider two factors: how well it captures the meaning of course titles and subjects (using a technique called cosine similarity), and how relevant the suggested courses are to user preferences. This relevance is measured by a combination of the cosine similarity score (higher scores indicate greater similarity) and user feedback on the recommendations. The consistently high cosine similarity score suggests the system effectively understands course content, and positive user feedback confirms the recommendations align well with their learning goals.
